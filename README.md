# virtual_puzzle
It puts nine parts of a photo on the screen as puzzle parts. This app utilizes computer vision (mediapipe, cvzone) to detect the user's hand and fingers in the webcam's image.

When the user's index finger is on a puzzle part on the screen, the user can drag the part and put it in the correct position.
I am open to any suggestions and changes in the app.

## install:
1. mediapipe 0.8.7
2. cvzone version 1.5.0
